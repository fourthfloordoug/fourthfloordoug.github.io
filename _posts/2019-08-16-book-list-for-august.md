# August List of Books

As always, I'm looking to remove tabs.  Here are some books I want to buy - and yeah, read too.  I've been thinking about ditching my kindle and going back to real books.  Not sure yet, but I like having a better record of what I've read other than the history page on the kindle, even if they're harder to move.

[Strategy A History](https://www.amazon.com/Strategy-History-Sir-Lawrence-Freedman-ebook/dp/B00F3D4IVG/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=strategy+a+history&qid=1563332369&s=gateway&sr=8-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=theschssta-20&linkId=72a677ea2a51cd78dc116b5d95e23d17&language=en_US) - A big history of how and why we employ strategy.

[British Military Innovation 1914-1918](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Fight-Innovation-1914-1918-Cambridge/dp/1107190797/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&linkCode=sl1&tag=lawgunandmon-20&linkId=9926275fb056f0fa9ff85e72fa80395e&language=en_US) - How did the British Army change throughout WWI in response to what they learned in the conflict.

The mills still fascinate me, even though I've never come near molten metal.

[Amity and Prosperity](https://www.amazon.com/Amity-Prosperity-Family-Fracturing-America/dp/0374103119) - Rural Pennsylvania, mining and environmental catastrophe.  Hits close to home.
