#What Is Doug Up To

Started using the [Atom](https://atom.io/) text editor.  It's really nice.  I like the simplicity of the git integration.  It's so much easier than the way that Eclipse implements it.  I feel like it makes it really easy to just commit all the time which should make projects run much more smoothly.  It looks like you have to go outside the editor to compile/run, but I'm not afraid to do that at the command line, so it shouldn't be a problem.

Also, I tried out [remark](https://github.com/gnab/remark) for making briefings.  Here is a basic [template](/about/testRemark.html).  It's pretty and easy.  I like that versus using all the heaviness of Power Point.
