#What Is Doug Up To?

I've been following the tutorial at [https://www.railstutorial.org] to make some basic Rails apps.  The first one is a simple "Hello World" that is hosted at [https://gentle-stream-14100.herokuapp.com/].  The code is [here](https://github.com/fourthfloordoug/helloRails).  It only does what it says.  The second is a basic twitter like app that is hosted at [https://fierce-oasis-96873.herokuapp.com/].  The code is [here](https://github.com/fourthfloordoug/railsToy).  This one uses a database to hold users in one table and their posts in another.  The application is pretty straight forward, and I believe that I will be able to use it to make my Chadsberry project.
