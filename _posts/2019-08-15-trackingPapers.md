#Tracking Papers

Just setting these here for future reading (read: clear tabs)

[Deep Learning in Video Multi-Object Tracking: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12740)
[ROAM: Recurrently Optimizing Tracking Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12006)

The first is a nice survey of DNN methods used in multi-object tracking.  They break the process down into a couple different steps, e.g. detection, association, ... Then look at the tools being used.

The second is a paper that looks at how you build bounding boxes.  They do some optimization to keep bounding boxes updating as the target potentially changes shape with motion.
