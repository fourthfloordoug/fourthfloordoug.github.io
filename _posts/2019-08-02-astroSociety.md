#Astronomy and Society

Two non-technical articles on astroPH recently that I liked.  

[Astro2020 APC White Paper: Tying Research Funding to Progress on Inclusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11245)
[Key Challenges for AAS Journals in the Next Decade](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13202)

The first one doesn't say that much in terms of what should be done.  Mostly it's pointing out the problems with astronomy journals in the modern world.  The main US based astronomy journals (ApJ, AJ) are run by the national organization itself as opposed to one of the evil publishing houses.  This is nice, but they still cost a lot of money, both in page costs and in subscriptions.  The page costs are arguably worse, because you don't really need a subscription to get at journals anymore.  Maybe there's things hiding in the real things that I can't get on arXiv (and maybe you can search them better), but I haven't seen it.  Forcing people to pay page charges out of grant money seems not so great in this era of no grant money.  Further, I learned that although MNRAS was always free on page charges, it is exceedingly expensive in subscription.  

I don't think there's a good answer to this until tenure committees decide to do something other than what they do now.  If you need articles in some "real" journal to keep your job, we'll continue to route grant money to the journals.  Nice work if you can get it.

The second article is what to do about inclusion and diversity in astronomy, obviously something I can get behind.  Their main point is to have funding agencies include this in their grants.  This is clearly the best option, and seems like you could get something done here as you're talking about public agencies giving to public agencies.  In my world, it would be more fraught given the interaction with private business, but I'm still all for it.  Mouthing words about diversity won't do anything until the money is on the line.
