# A New Hope

Here's to hoping I keep writing on here.

I've transferred a lot of the reading that I used to do on my work machine to my personal computer.  Someone may not like me saying this, but I don't get a lot of credit for what I do.  It's certainly entertaining to me, and maybe someone else reads it (well, they don't), but I want to be able to take it with me if I ever leave here, or if the powers that be ever change the internal web services, which could have happened recently.  So, I'll blog here now.  Expect to see my discussion revolve around papers/topics in the machine learning world and some topics in the defense policy world.
