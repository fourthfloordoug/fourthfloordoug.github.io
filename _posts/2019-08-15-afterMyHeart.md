[Investing for Discovery in Astronomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11700)

The TLDR; is that you should be investing both in big telescopes and small ones to progress the field.  She has a nice chart of recent discoveries in the community and what types of telescopes were used.  It turns out that it's actually a mix of them.  Crowding out all of the 1-2m telescopes so that you can only build football stadium sized mirrors doesn't actually push the field because there's only so many nights.  (And there's only so many available locations as the fight with the native Hawaiians is showing.)  

I used both kinds in my research back in grad school, but I'm (obviously) biased to smaller systems.  Perhaps that's because my big telescope work was with the VLA and by the time I used it, it was old news.  If you want discovery to happen, you have to open up places where it can happen for people with different ideas.  You also have to have places where people can practice and get to understand what is actually involved in observing.  I wonder how far that has gone in the past 15 years I've been out where instrumentationist people and operators are diverging from astronomers and also data scientists.  How much astronomy would you have to know to be successful in the astronomy world.  Certainly I don't know much and I wasn't that successful, but maybe that's different now.

The paper talks about the need for diverse instrumentation and team size.  I also wonder if having this type of diversity would lead to a diversity of people as well.  On small systems people from non-typical backgrounds could potentially get the chance to lead programs yielding discovery (and later jobs) that might not happen with the truly large collaborations at the big systems.  You're going to have to be an already established scientist and political operator to get there.  We know what those people look like.

So, yay small telescopes.
